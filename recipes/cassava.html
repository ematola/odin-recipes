    <h1>Cassava</h1>
    <img src="imagens/cassava.jpeg">
    <p>This recipe for cassava cake consists of two (2) processes. The first is making the cassava batter, and the second is preparing the topping.</p>
    <p>Let’s start with the batter. Combine the grated cassava, butter, milk, a portion of the cheese, sugar, eggs, and coconut milk in a mixing bowl. Use a wire whist to mix all the ingredients together. This step will only take a couple of minutes to complete.</p>
    <p>You will need to grab a baking pan and grease it with oil. You can simply spray cooking oil such as Pam, or you can pour around 1 teaspoon of oil and spread it using your fingers. Pour the cassava mixture to the baking pan. At this point, the oven should have been preheated.</p>
